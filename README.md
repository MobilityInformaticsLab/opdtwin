# üöç Open Public Transport Digital Twin (OPDTwin) 

Despite its practical potential, the current adoptation of Digital Twins (DT) in the transportation domain and especially in Public Transport (PT) is relatively slow. A significant barrier is the substantial effort and investment in resources required during the development phase, especially for informative visualizations, thus limiting its accessibility to PT agencies. 

Thus, we proposes an automated development pipeline of DT for PT, which uses open-source software and data that make it easy to access and extend. 

Stay tuned: This repository will be updated shortly. In the meantime, feel free to explore the functionality of our Public Transport Digital Twin (PT DT) for Kista, Stockholm, Sweden, by watching the video üé• below.
